Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Code kopieren
git clone https://https://github.com/ohawas21/Breast_Cancer_Detector

Usage
Load your dataset: Update the script to point to your dataset file.
Preprocess the data: Ensure to handle missing values and encode categorical features.
Train the model: Run the training script to fit the model on the training data.
Evaluate the model: After training, evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
Make predictions: Use the trained model to predict new patient data.
Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains patient attributes, such as:

Age
Tumor size
Lymph node status
Histological grade
Other relevant features
Each instance in the dataset is labeled as either benign or malignant.

Model Evaluation
The model's performance is assessed using:

Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)
These metrics help to understand the accuracy of the predictions and the effectiveness of the model.
